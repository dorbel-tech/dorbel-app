# dorbel front end application

## Install
``npm install``

## Running
You'll need to run two terminals
1. One for the main application - ``npm run start:dev``
2. One for the hot-reload server - ``npm run build:dev``
3. If you have ``tmux`` installed you can run ``./scripts/run`` to run both commands in a split screen
